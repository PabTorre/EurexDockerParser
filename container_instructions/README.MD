# Collection of useful docker instructions


This folder contains a collection of docker instructions that come in handy.

Don't build your docker file here...

Instead copy Dockerfile to your parser folder, then run the instructions in
build_container.sh to build it there...

make any modifications you need, like installing libraries, in that folder.
